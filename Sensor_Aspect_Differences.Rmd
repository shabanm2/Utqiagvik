*Run Multidepth_Averaging_and_Plotting script for data loading prior to running this*

# need cleaned data input prior to running

*Max, mins, and averages for dataset*
```{r}
df2_tnha <- dfgrndtemp %>% filter(!station == "BUECI", depth == "90cm")

tnhagrnd_maxmin <- df2_tnha %>% # at 10cm depths for TNHA what are each sensors maximum and minimum values
  group_by(sensor) %>%
  mutate(
    Maxval = max(value, na.rm = T),
    Minval = min(value, na.rm = T),
    mean_val = mean(value, na.rm = T)
  ) %>%
  arrange(sensor)

#below, all of these yield the same average for the season!
tnhagrnd_maxmin %>% distinct(sensor,Maxval,Minval,mean_val)
tnhagrnd_maxmin %>% aggregate(mean_val ~ sensor,mean)
